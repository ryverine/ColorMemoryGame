GitHub Pages deploy was a bit quarrelsome.

Arnaud's article helped me get my React app deployed.

This article had me create the `gh-pages` branch manually and push the resulting content of `npm run build` to that branch.

Previous articles seemed to rely on the built-in funcionality of [gh-pages npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages), like the [create=-react-app deployment guide](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment).

I could not get my app deployed wih those dircetion on account of recieving a `Could not read from remote repository` error after executing `npm run deploy`.
